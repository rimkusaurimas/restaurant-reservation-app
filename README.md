## Reflection

This was a 3 month long project which was made for Sourcery Academy by Devbridge front-end developement course. 
We were given a full design of the project. Our goul throughout the course was to implement best code practices, code cleanliness, simplicity, component oriented developement.
This project was a really great practice for our team, having in mind that all of the contributors had little to-none prior experience with ReactJS. After finishing the course we were happy with our results, achievements and progress that was made.
At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Context API, Moudule SCSS, MirageJS, Fetch API, Storybook, React hook forms, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and SCSS.
